# Project Rework Summary: Modification System Refactoring

**Overall Goal:** Refactor the game's modification system to use a centralized, composition-based approach with a `ComposableModificationManager`, enabling easier scaling and addition of new, unique modifications.

**Current State of Refactoring:**

1.  **Strategy Pattern Implementation:**
    *   Introduced `IModification` interface and `BaseModification` abstract class to define a contract for all modifications, including various game event "hooks" (e.g., `ApplyOnShoot`, `ModifyIncomingDamage`, `ApplyOnUpdate`, `ApplyOnKill`, `GetModifiedValue`, `GetProjectileCount`) and metadata properties (`Name`, `Description`, `Material`).
    *   Created concrete classes for most existing `ModificationType` enums (e.g., `BurnEffectModification`, `DoubleDamageAndTakenModification`, `ReflectDamageModification`, `HealOnKillModification`, `InvulnerabilityOnHitModification`, `MoneyEqualsLifeModification`, `MoveSpeedIncreaseModification`, `MultiplyMultiplyValueModification`, `GhostLaserModification`). Each class encapsulates its specific logic and metadata.
    *   `utility/Modification.cs` was refactored to act as a factory, instantiating the appropriate `IModification` strategy object based on the `ModificationType`.
    *   `ComposableModificationManager.cs` was updated to iterate through its collection of `Modification` objects and invoke the corresponding hook methods on their `IModification` strategy instances.

2.  **Consumer Script Updates:**
    *   `Player.cs`: Refactored to use `ComposableModificationManager`'s hook methods for damage calculation, invulnerability, healing on kill, and projectile handling. `denyDamageSound` was made public for access by `InvulnerabilityOnHitModification`.
    *   `Weapon.cs`: Refactored to use `ComposableModificationManager`'s `GetModifiedValue` for damage calculation and `GetProjectileCount` for projectile count, and `ApplyOnShoot` for special effects.
    *   `MovementManager.cs`: Refactored to use `ComposableModificationManager`'s `GetModifiedValue` for speed increases.
    *   `GameManager.cs`: Updated to use `player.modManager.ApplyOnKill(player)` and removed direct `MoneyEqualsLife` checks (now handled by `MoneyEqualsLifeModification`).
    *   `ModificationObject.cs`: Updated to directly use `mod.Strategy.Material` for visual representation.
    *   `utility/StoreItem.cs`: Updated to directly use `mod.Strategy.Name` and `mod.Strategy.Description` for display text.
    *   Dependency injection was implemented for `ComposableModificationManager` into `Enemy` and `MovementManager` to maintain proper architectural layering.

**Known Issues / Next Steps:**

1.  **UI Breakage (FIXED):** âœ… **RESOLVED** - The UI breakage was caused by null Strategy references in the modification system. Fixed by:
    * Adding null safety checks in `ModificationObject.cs` when accessing `Strategy.Material`
    * Adding null safety checks in `StoreItem.cs` when accessing `Strategy.Name` and `Strategy.Description`
    * Implementing missing `Name`, `Description`, and `Material` properties in `AddFlatValueModification` and `AddMultiplyValueModification` classes
    * Changing the `CreateStrategy` method to throw proper exceptions instead of returning null for unknown modification types
    * **Fixed slot indexing issue**: Modifications now go to slot 0, 1, 2, etc. instead of starting at slot 1
    * **Fixed material loading**: Updated all material paths to use correct "Lens" suffix (e.g., "Materials/AddFlatValueLens")

2.  **Modification Dropping System (PARTIALLY FIXED):** ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS** - Fixed null references, but pickup interaction may need further investigation:
    * Player presses 'G' key to trigger `ModManager.DropItems()`
    * This calls `GameManager.OnDrop()` which calls `player.DropModifications()`
    * `player.DropModifications()` clears the UI, gets current modifications, clears the manager, and returns the modifications
    * `ModManager` then creates buyable items on the ground for each dropped modification
    * **Issue**: Dropped modifications may disappear immediately due to destroy callback timing
    * **Next step**: Investigate interaction timing and pickup behavior

3.  **`RubberDuckModification` Implementation (COMPLETED):** âœ… **DONE** - Created `RubberDuckModification` class with proper `Name`, `Description`, and `Material` properties.

4.  **Material System (FIXED):** âœ… **RESOLVED** - Updated all modification classes to use correct material paths:
    * Changed from "Materials/XxxMaterial" to "Materials/XxxLens" format
    * All materials now load correctly from the existing material files

5.  **`ModManager.cs` Deprecation:** The `ModManager` singleton is still present but should be fully deprecated and removed once all its direct usages are replaced.

6.  **Documentation Update:** The `docs/7modification_and_item_system.md` file is now outdated and should be updated or removed to reflect the new architecture.
